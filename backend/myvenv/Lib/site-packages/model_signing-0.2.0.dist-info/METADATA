# Model Signing

This project demonstrates how to protect the integrity of a model by signing it
with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/), a tool for making code signatures
transparent without requiring management of cryptographic key material.

When users download a given version of a signed model they can check that the
signature comes from a known or trusted identity and thus that the model hasn't
been tampered with after training.

Signing events are recorded to Sigstore's append-only transparency log.
Transparency logs make signing events discoverable: Model verifiers can validate
that the models they are looking at exist in the transparency log by checking a
proof of inclusion (which is handled by the model signing library).
Furthermore, model signers that monitor the log can check for any unexpected
signing events.

Model signers should monitor for occurences of their signing identity in the
log. Sigstore is actively developing a [log
monitor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor) that runs on GitHub Actions.

## Model Signing CLI

The `sign.py` and `verify.py` scripts aim to provide the necessary functionality
to sign and verify ML models. For signing and verification the following methods
are supported:

* Bring your own key pair
* Bring your own PKI
- Keyless signing using Sigstore with Fulcio root
* Skip signing (only hash and create a bundle)

The signing part creates a [sigstore bundle](https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/main/protos/sigstore_bundle.proto)
protobuf that is stored as in JSON format. The bundle contains the verification
material necessary to check the payload and a payload as a [DSSE envelope](https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/main/protos/envelope.proto).
Further the DSSE envelope contains an in-toto statment and the signature over
that statement. The signature format and how the the signature is computed can
be seen [here](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse/blob/v1.0.0/protocol.md).

Finally, the statement itself contains subjects which are a list of (file path,
digest) pairs a predicate type set to `model_signing/v1/model`and a dictionary
f predicates. The idea is to use the predicates to store (and therefor sign) model
card information in the future.

The verification part reads the sigstore bundle file and firstly verifies that the
signature is valid and secondly compute the model's file hashes again to compare
against the signed ones.

**Note**: The signature is stored as `./model.sig` by default and can be adjusted
by setting the `--sig_out` flag.

### Usage

There are two scripts one can be used to create and sign a bundle and the other to
verify a bundle. Furthermore, the functionality can be used directly from other
Python tools. The `sign.py` and `verify.py` scripts can be used as canonical
how-to examples.

The easiest way to use the scripts directly is from a virtual environment:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install -r install/requirements.in
```

## Sign

```bash
(.venv) $ python3 sign.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --sig_out ${SIG_PATH} {private-key, pki, sigstore} {additional parameters depending on method}
```

## Verify

```bash
(.venv) $ python3 verify.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --sig_path ${SIG_PATH} {private-key, pki, sigstore} {additional parameters depending on method}
```

### Examples

#### Bring Your Own Key

```bash
$ MODEL_PATH='/path/to/your/model'
$ SIG_PATH='./model.sig'
$ openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout -out ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem
$ openssl ec -in ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem -pubout > ec-secp256k1-pub-key.pem
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# SIGN
(.venv) $ python3 sign.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --sig_out ${SIG_PATH} private-key --private-key ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem
...
#VERIFY
(.venv) $ python3 verify.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --sig_path ${SIG_PATH} private-key --public-key ec-secp256k1-pub-key.pem
...
```

#### Bring your own PKI
In order to sign a model with your own PKI you need to create the following information:

    - The signing certificate
    - The elliptic curve private key matching the signing certificate's public key
    - Optionally, the certificate chain used for verification.


```bash
$ MODEL_PATH='/path/to/your/model'
$ SIG_PATH='./model.sig'
$ CERT_CHAIN='/path/to/cert_chain'
$ SIGNING_CERT='/path/to/signing_certificate'
$ PRIVATE_KEY='/path/to/private_key'
# SIGN
(.venv) $ python3 sign.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} \
    --sig_path ${SIG_PATH} \
    pki \
    --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} \
    --signing_cert ${SIGNING_CERT} \
    [--cert_chain ${CERT_CHAIN}]
...
#VERIFY
$ ROOT_CERTS='/path/to/root/certs'
(.venv) $ python3 verify.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} \
    --sig_path ${SIG_PATH} \
    pki \
    --root_certs ${ROOT_CERTS}
...
```

#### Keyless signing using Sigstore

```bash
$ MODEL_PATH='/path/to/your/model'
# SIGN
(.venv) $ python3 sign.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} sigstore
...
#VERIFY
(.venv) $ python3 verify.py --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --sig_path ./model.sig sigstore --identity name@example.com --identity-provider https://accounts.example.com
...
```

### Sigstore ID providers

For developers signing models with Sigstore, there are three identity providers that can
be used at the moment:

* Google's provider is `https://accounts.google.com`.
* GitHub's provider is `https://github.com/login/oauth`.
* Microsoft's provider is `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

For automated signing using a workload identity, the following platforms
are currently supported, shown with their expected identities:

* GitHub Actions
  (`https://github.com/octo-org/octo-automation/.github/workflows/oidc.yml@refs/heads/main`)
* GitLab CI
  (`https://gitlab.com/my-group/my-project//path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml@refs/heads/main`)
* Google Cloud Platform (`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
* Buildkite CI (`https://buildkite.com/ORGANIZATION_SLUG/PIPELINE_SLUG`)

### Supported Models

The library supports multiple models, from multiple training frameworks and
model hubs.

For example, to sign and verify a Bertseq2seq model, trained with TensorFlow,
stored in TFHub, run the following commands:

```bash
model_path=bertseq2seq
sig_path=model.sig
wget "https://tfhub.dev/google/bertseq2seq/bert24_en_de/1?tf-hub-format=compressed" -O "${model_path}".tgz
mkdir -p "${model_path}"
cd "${model_path}" && tar xvzf ../"${model_path}".tgz && rm ../"${model_path}".tgz && cd -
python3 sign.py --model_path "${model_path}" sigstore
python3 verify.py --model_path "${model_path}" --sig_path ${sig_path} \
    sigstore \
    --identity-provider https://accounts.google.com \
    --identity myemail@gmail.com
```

For models stored in Hugging Face we need the large file support from git, which
can be obtained via

```bash
sudo apt install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

After this, we can sign and verify a Bert base model:

```bash
model_name=bert-base-uncased
model_path="${model_name}"
sig_path=model.sig
git clone --depth=1 "https://huggingface.co/${model_name}" && rm -rf "${model_name}"/.git
python3 sign.py --model_path "${model_path}"
python3 verify.py --model_path "${model_path}" --sig_path ${sig_path} \
    sigstore \
    --identity-provider https://accounts.google.com \
    --identity myemail@gmail.com
```

Similarly, we can sign and verify a Falcon model:

```bash
model_name=tiiuae/falcon-7b
model_path=$(echo "${model_name}" | cut -d/ -f2)
sig_path=model.sig
git clone --depth=1 "https://huggingface.co/${model_name}" && rm -rf "${model_name}"/.git
python3 sign.py --model_path "${model_path}"
python3 verify.py --model_path "${model_path}" --sig_path ${sig_path} \
    sigstore \
    --identity-provider https://accounts.google.com \
    --identity myemail@gmail.com
```

We can also support models from  the PyTorch Hub:

```bash
model_name=hustvl/YOLOP
model_path=$(echo "${model_name}" | cut -d/ -f2)
sig_path=model.sig
wget "https://github.com/${model_name}/archive/main.zip" -O "${model_path}".zip
mkdir -p "${model_path}"
cd "${model_path}" && unzip ../"${model_path}".zip && rm ../"${model_path}".zip && shopt -s dotglob && mv YOLOP-main/* . && shopt -u dotglob && rmdir YOLOP-main/ && cd -
python3 sign.py --model_path "${model_path}"
python3 verify.py --model_path "${model_path}" --sig_path ${sig_path} \
    sigstore \
    --identity-provider https://accounts.google.com \
    --identity myemail@gmail.com
```

We also support ONNX models, for example Roberta:

```bash
model_name=roberta-base-11
model_path="${model_name}.onnx"
sig_path=model.sig

## Benchmarking

Install as per [Usage section](#usage).
Ensure you have enough disk space:
- if passing 3rd script argument as `true`: at least 50GB
- otherwise: at least 100GB

To run the benchmarks:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sigstore/model-transparency.git
cd model-transparency/model_signing
bash benchmarks/run.sh https://accounts.google.com myemail@gmail.com [true]
```

A single run was performed.

Hashes used:
- H1: Hashing using a tree representation of the directory.
- H2: Hashing using a list representation of the directory. (Implementation is parallized with shards of 1GB sizes across vCPUs).

## Model Signing Format

For a diagram showing the model signing format as well as an explanation of the
layers, see the [model signing format](docs/model_signing_format.md) document.

## Development steps

### Linting

`model_signing` is automatically linted and formatted with a collection of tools:

* [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
* [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype)

You can run the type checker locally by installing the `dev` dependencies:
```shell
python3 -m venv dev_env
source dev_env/bin/activate
os=Linux # Supported: Linux, Darwin.
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r "install/requirements_dev_${os}".txt
```

Then point pytype at the desired module or package:
```shell
pytype --keep-going model_signing/hashing
```
